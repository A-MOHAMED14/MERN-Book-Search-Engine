# MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

The MERN: Book Search Engine is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for books, save their favorite books, and view their saved books list. Originally built with a RESTful API, this project has been refactored to use GraphQL with Apollo Server for improved performance and flexibility.
