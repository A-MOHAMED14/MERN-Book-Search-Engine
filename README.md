# MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

The MERN: Book Search Engine is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for books, save their favorite books, and view their saved books list. Originally built with a RESTful API, this project has been refactored to use GraphQL with Apollo Server for improved performance and flexibility.

## üé• Application Demo

As you can see in the following animation, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:

The user can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result, as shown in the following animation:

A user can view their saved books on a separate page, as shown in the following animation:
